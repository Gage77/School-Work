Evolution of Low Mass Stars:

	Pre-Main Sequence Evolution Track
	- mass establishes a stars evolutionary track
	- falls to main sequence after being a protostar

	- Stars are constantly radiating energy by converting hydrogen to helium in their cores
	- eventually fusion sources change
	- stars life depends primarily on mass and composition
	- 0.8M 
	- Main sequence stars fuse hydrogen to helium in cores
	- helium core doesn't fuse, gravity wins over pressure, crushing the helium
	- core becomes more dense, and becomes electron-degenerate (quantom mechanical effect of pressure)
	Moves to Red Giant Branch
	- When fuel runs out of core, the luminosity increases
	- when the core shrinks, its gravitational pull gets stronger
	- helium fuses to carbon via the triple-alpha process (helium flash)
		- so now carbon core with helium shell then hydrogen shell
	- ration of hydrogen to helium in the hydrogen shell is 3/1
	Asymptotic Giant Branch
	- Mass loss means the star becomes very puffed up, and cannot hold onto the outer layers easily
	- outer layers ejected to space
	- this is the planetary nebula stuff
	- after that, the outer layers are ejected revealing the white dwarf within

	Binary Stars
	- most stars are binary systems
	- in each pair of low-mass stars, the more massive one evolves first
	- can only expand so much before it begins to lose material due to the other star's gravitational pull
	- when enough mass gets passed to the smaller star (white dwarf), nuclear reactions can start, and the star gets much brighter temporarily
	- this is called a nova
	- another phenomena is when the mass gets so large that it exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit (1.4M), at which point the star explodes
	- this is called a Type 1a Supernova
	- supernova is as luminous as 10 billion suns

Evolution of High-Mass Stars

	- High mass stars live different, faster lives
	- on main sequence, energy is generated from the CNO cycle, with carbon as a catalyst
	- once H is exhausted from the core, the star leaves the MS and expands and cools, moving right in the H-R diagram into the Supergiant area
	- once there, they can fall into the instability strip, becoming variable stars called cephaes
	- Ignite He in a non-degenerate core, unlike lowmass stars
	- central temperature continues to rise
	- heavier elemtns fuse, generating energy
	- more massive the star, the heavier the elemtns that can fuse
	- high mass stars will fuse elemnts up until iron
	- the fusion shells build up like layers of an onion
	- fusion of iron or more massive elemtns requires energy
	0 once the star has an iron core, it cannot generate more energy
	- each stage of burning is progressively shorter
		- C burning lasts for 1000 years
		- Si burning only lasts for a few days
	- Nutrinoes are produced throughout this process, contributing to the short time of change
	Cepheid Variables
		- High mass
	RR Lyrae Variables
		- low-mass 
	- Massive stars have winds
	- core collapse, central temp rises
	- photodisintegration, neutrino colling reduces pressure, collapse accelerates
	- electron degeneracy cannot help
	- Collapses until it reaches nuclear densities
		- at this high densities nuclear forces repel atoms
	- core stops, bounces back, driving a shock wave through the star, causing the star to explode
	- Called a Type II supernova, leaving a core (nutron star) or a black hole, depending on the mass
	Binary Systems
	- Neutron star left over from supernova
	- mass above 1.4M
	- binary systems result in strong X-rays
	- others are found as pulsars (rapidly rotating neutron stars)
		- highly magnetized
	- if the mass of a neutron star exceeds 3M it will collapse to a black hole
	Star cluster
	- high mass stars evolve first. We can use this turnover point as an aging point for the cluster

Relativity
	
	- galileo's transformation
	- mass and energy are the same thing
	- the speed of light is the ultimate speed limit
	- time passes more slowly in a moving reference frame
	- "simultaneous" is relative
	- Twins paradox effect
	- mass distors the geometry of spacetime
	- can think of mass as warping a rubber sheet
	- the presence of the mass changes how objects move on the rubber sheet
	- gravitational redshift stretches the wavelength of light leaving a large ass
	- gravitational waves shoudl travel through the fabric of spacetime at the speed of light
	- Schwarchild radius
	- gravitational field of a black hole = singularity
	- radiate hawking energy
