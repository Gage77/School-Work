1. Use Keyboard input to get information from the user.
	We met this milestone. This was done through JOptionPane dialogs with the user
	seen in the Driver.java class. 

2. Use text file I/O to read and write text files.
	We met this milestone. This was done by getting a file from the user through 
	JOptionPane dialogs to read in Movie and Series data. To write text files, we 
	used the FileWriter and BufferedWriter classes.

3. Create classes to store data on movies and broadcast series. Note that you should
create any additional classes (abstract and/or concrete) and/or interfaces you deem
necessary to arrive at a good design.
	We met this milestone, as seen in the Movie.java, TvSeries.java, TvEpisode.java, 
	and TvDataBase.java

4. Implement both the Comparable and Comparator interfaces to compare one movie or
broadcast series to another.
	We kind of met this. We did implement the Comparator interface in the TvSeries.java/TvEpisode.java
	but not in the Movie.java. This was because we found a seperate way to search by title/year. 
	when sorting the Movie collection by year, we parsed the final four char which were the year "xxxx" 
	and created a new String that would be added to the ArrayList. Then we sorted and since 
	the year is in the beginning that is how it will sort, after it is sorted we removed the year 
	and have it back to it original position. 
 
5. Use a List to store, retrieve, and display data related to movies and broadcast series as
described below.
	We met this milestone. We implemented Arrays and ArrayLists in order to store data and 
	objects which were later accessed to display to the user.

6. Use the sort() and binarySearch() methods from the Collections class to sort and
search for data related to movies and broadcast series as described below.
	We met this milestone, as seen in the Movie.java and TvDataBase.java.
