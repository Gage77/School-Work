Milestone #1: Implement Serializable for the classes necessary to save and load all application data		(10 pts)
	We met this milestone
Milestone #2: Use object serialization to save and load the application data to and from a binary file 		(15 pts)
	We kind of met this milestone. We were unable to test whether or not this works, but most
	of the implementation is there
Milestone #3: Implement a simple graphical display for showing counts of the application data			(25 pts)
	We didn't really meet this milestone. We ran out of time to get the graphical display
	to work.
Milestone #4: Create appropriate classes to store information on media makers					(10 pts)
	We met this milestone by implementing a MediaMaker class which contained all information
	for each individual MediaMaker (acting/directing/producing). These MediaMaker objects are 
	then stored in a Database object for further encapsulation.
Milestone #5: Use LinkedHashMaps to save to and retrieve information on media makers				(10 pts)
	We met this milestone by implementing a LinkedHashMap into the pdb Database object. This 
	LinkedHashMap contains MediaMaker objects with the key being their name (last, first).

Other points of grading:
	1) Develop and use a proper design (see Milestone 4 above)						(15 pts)
	2) Use proper documentation and formatting								(15 pts)
