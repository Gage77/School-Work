To achieve the screenshot in this directory, I:

- Moved the hopscotch to the left by a few sidewalk panels and down a little bit using the <shift><left-arrow> keys, and the <down-arrow> key

- Selected a star using the <tab> key, and highlighted it in orance

- Closed the window frames shades by pressing the <w> key

- Changed the number of panels on the kite by pressing the <3> key
