My sketch reflects most portions of the guidelines setup by my team. I grouped buttons that should be grouped together (namely the checkbox filter button), however I chose to group them vertically rather than in a grid, as I figured that grouping them vertically would decrease the overall mouse movment more than a grid format would. Additionally, I felt that a list of checkboxes was easier to read than a grid of checkboxes. I made the add button "wider" in terms of its Fitt's Law calculations by making it more square, and moving it to the top right of the screen. I also added tabs to the screen to better filter the information displayed to the user.
