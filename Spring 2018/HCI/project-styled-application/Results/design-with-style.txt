My design fulfills a majority of the design and style principles layed out by our group. The design successfully implements the change in color for all major buttons (the back/add/toolbar buttons). Additionally, I was able to change the selection color in our JTable to our desired yellow color rather than blue. I was unable, however, to change the default color of certain rows of the JTable to our desired red color based on expiration date and quantity values. I was also unable to implement our "overlapping" selection colors on the JTable due to the same reasoning.

For our menu layout, I removed the change color options, as we decided that this option would not suit well with our desired color scheme. I chose to leave in the theme selection section, as the two fulfill relatively similar functions.
